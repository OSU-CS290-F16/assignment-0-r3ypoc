	I found this assignment to be pretty straight forward. I've had plenty of experience with Git before. Though I did have some difficulty getting git configured with the Putty Terminal, so I eventually switched over to developing on my Linux desktop.

	In this assignment I learned how to code a basic html file to display text and a picture. I already knew how to use git coming into this assignment.
